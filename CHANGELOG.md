# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## v3.2.1

Validated on a Samsung DU7700 streaming at 4K: no complaints about picture or audio.
This is the first release since v2.0.0 to be confirmed on hardware, and everything
between the two was reasoned about rather than measured.

### Fixed
- Fixed the stall detector being able to fire on a healthy stream. It required the reported position to be unchanged for a fixed 750 ms, but the platform's reporting interval is neither documented nor ours to choose: a platform that reports once a second leaves the position legitimately unchanged for that long, and the detector would then flush the pipeline on every reporting interval, turning the protection into the fault. The threshold now calibrates itself against the largest gap observed while presentation was known to be advancing, and only a gap several times longer than anything healthy counts

## v3.2.0

### Fixed
- Fixed *Restore Defaults* leaving three switches showing the opposite of what it saved. *Optimize game settings*, *Rumble feedback* and *Mouse emulation* were stored as on while their switches were set to off, so the screen disagreed with the configuration until the next start
- Fixed audio being discarded whenever the scheduled buffer ran past its target. A network burst pushed the buffer deep and every frame beyond the target was thrown away, which is an audible discontinuity. The buffer is now drained by consuming slightly faster than it arrives, and a frame is only discarded when the backlog is large enough that draining it would hold latency high for many seconds
- Fixed a decoded audio frame being playable after the feeder had reused its slot. The pool was deep enough to make it unlikely and nothing detected it when it happened; each slot now carries a version, the scheduler re-reads it after copying, and a frame spliced from two different moments is counted and dropped instead of played

### Added
- Audio and video are now servoed against each other. The scheduler compares where the pipeline reports it is against how much audio has actually been played, calibrating the fixed offset between the two clocks once per epoch, and corrects the difference through playback rate. Without the epoch calibration the comparison is meaningless: the two timelines have no reason to share an origin
- Presentation stall detection. If the platform keeps accepting packets while the reported position stops advancing, the pipeline is flushed and a keyframe requested, from a worker rather than from the submission path. The detector stays disarmed unless the platform has proved it reports position and that the position was advancing
- The performance overlay reports the share of frames submitted without assembly, hand-over retries and pipeline recoveries

### Changed
- A decode unit that arrives contiguous is handed to the platform where it lies, with no assembly copy. That is every frame except a keyframe, which needs the copy anyway because its H.264 SPS is rewritten in transit
- A refused packet is retried three times with a short backoff before it costs a frame or a keyframe request. The worst case adds under 2 ms, well inside a frame interval
- Each stream stamps a generation onto its audio, so a frame published while the previous stream was being torn down cannot be scheduled against the new stream's clock
- The audio jitter buffer default is 50 ms. It is now the setpoint a rate servo holds rather than a threshold above which audio is dropped, so it no longer has to carry slack for bursts

## v3.1.1

### Fixed
- Fixed gamepad polling putting hundreds of blocking round trips a second on the main thread. `emscripten_sample_gamepad_data`, `emscripten_get_num_gamepads` and `emscripten_get_gamepad_status` are all declared `__proxy: 'sync'` in the SDK, because the Gamepad API only exists on the main thread, so the 5 ms poll on the input worker was six hundred synchronous crossings a second onto the same thread that schedules audio and services the media pipeline. Gamepad state is now read on the main thread by a `requestAnimationFrame` loop, written into the WASM heap, and read from there by the worker without any proxying

## v3.1.0

### Added
- H.264 SPS rewriting. The stream is always low delay, but the SPS the host sends does not say so, and a hardware decoder reading no bitstream restrictions sizes its picture buffer from `level_idc` and holds several frames before showing one. The SPS now declares no reordering, a single buffered frame and a single reference frame, and lowers `level_idc` to the smallest level that fits the resolution. This is the rewrite `moonlight-android` performs on every device since Android 8, and it is staged so it can be narrowed without editing the source
- Opus packet loss concealment. A packet the network lost was previously skipped, leaving a hole in the scheduled audio; the decoder is now asked to conceal it, which also keeps its internal state continuous for the frames that follow
- H.264 is announced alongside HEVC and AV1 as a fallback format, so a host that cannot encode the selected codec negotiates down instead of failing to connect. An explicit H.264 selection is unaffected

### Changed
- Defaults changed for a working out-of-the-box configuration: 1080p at 20 Mbps (was 720p at 10 Mbps), HEVC (was H.264), audio jitter buffer 60 ms (was 100 ms), *Optimize game settings*, *Rumble feedback* and *Mouse emulation* on (all were off), and *Frame pacing* off. The first three match `moonlight-android`; frame pacing matches its `DEFAULT_FRAME_PACING = "latency"`, where the newest frame is presented on arrival rather than held for a deadline
- *Game Mode* now defaults off on every platform version. It selects the EMSS ultra low latency mode, which freezes playback on the first frame on some models, and it is also the switch that must stay off in the ForceGM build where the panel is put into Game Mode by widget metadata. Defaulting it on meant a fresh install could land on the one combination that does not work
- The frame pacer waits against the pipeline's own reported position when the platform provides it, instead of always estimating from local elapsed time, and hands each frame over one frame duration before it is due so the pipeline is never left with nothing in hand
- Audio buffers are drawn from a pool rather than allocated per frame, and the sample conversion no longer looks up the heap view per sample

## v3.0.0

### Fixed
- Fixed the presentation timeline carrying the host clock's quantisation into every frame. moonlight-common-c derives `presentationTimeMs` from the 90 kHz RTP timestamp with an integer division by 90, so at 60 FPS the deltas repeat 16, 17, 17 rather than a uniform 16.667 ms. Following them injected a periodic third of a millisecond of error into each frame's presentation time and into the pacer deadline derived from it. The timeline is now generated at a uniform step, with the step slowly adapted so it stays locked to the host's rate, and the number of frames to advance taken from the frame number rather than the timestamp
- Fixed video track setup continuing after the track was rejected, which produced a stream that opened and showed nothing instead of a clear failure

### Changed
- HEVC below 1440p now declares level 4.1 instead of 5.1. The declared level sizes the decoder's picture buffer: at 1080p, level 5.1 yields a buffer of 16 pictures and level 4.1 yields 6. Configurations are tried in order and fall back to the previous level 5.1 if the decoder rejects the smaller one

## v2.1.0

### Fixed
- Fixed frames being discarded from the bitstream without requesting a keyframe. Once the decode unit queue passed a threshold, P-frames were dropped and reported as handled. The stream carries no periodic keyframes, so the decoder was left referencing a picture it never received and the error propagated until an IDR was requested for some unrelated reason. Rare queue overload is now left to moonlight-common-c, which flushes and requests a keyframe, costing one clean recovery instead of lasting corruption

### Added
- The performance overlay now reports frame delivery interval and its standard deviation, the percentage of frames delivered off cadence, and the depth of the platform's own playback buffer. Averages alone cannot distinguish a steady frame rate from a bursty one

### Changed
- Frame pacing now defaults to on for new installations. Existing settings are preserved

## v2.0.0

First release of this fork, based on upstream v1.13.1. The version starts a line of
its own rather than continuing upstream's, so that the two are never confused.

### Fixed
- Fixed video stuttering caused by the frame pacer busy-waiting on the decoder thread, and by its once-a-second step correction releasing held frames in a burst
- Fixed the video timeline drifting shorter on every lost frame, by following the host presentation clock instead of counting accepted frames
- Fixed audio stuttering by rendering audio through the Web Audio API instead of the Tizen elementary media source, whose audio track shares the pipeline that stutters
- Fixed Opus decoding running on the UDP receive thread, where any stall became real packet loss
- Fixed gamepad polling continuing on the main thread during streaming

### Changed
- The dead *Audio synchronization* toggle is now an *Audio jitter buffer* slider (50–500 ms, default 100)
- Builds with `-O3` instead of `-Os`
- Reports the client refresh rate and colour space to the host
