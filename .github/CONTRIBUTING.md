# Contributing

Thanks for contributing to the Moonlight project! Whether you're opening an issue or proposing a pull request, your help is greatly appreciated.

## General Guidelines

- Use proper English. It doesn't have to be complicated, just make it simple and understandable for everyone.
- Clearly explain your feature request or the problem you're facing.
- Include screenshots when possible.
- When posting an issue, include logs if available (please remove or mask your private IP).

## Reporting Issues

If you want to report a bug or request a feature, please use the appropriate issue template:
- **Bug Report** – use this if you found an issue or unexpected behavior
- **Feature Request** – use this if you want to propose a new feature or improvement

These templates will guide you to include all the necessary information to helps us **diagnose and resolve issues faster**.

## Development Setup

If you want to contribute code, you should first make sure you can build the project locally.

Please follow the [development guide](https://github.com/brightcraft/moonlight-tizen/wiki/Development-Guide) available in the Wiki.

This guide explains how to build Moonlight for Tizen and run it on your device.

## Pull Requests

If you want to contribute code, please follow these guidelines:
- Keep pull requests **focused on a single feature or fix**.
- Avoid combining multiple unrelated changes in the same PR.
- Make sure the project **builds successfully** before submitting.
- Clearly describe **what the PR does and why it is needed**.
- Test your changes as much as possible before submitting.

Large PRs are harder to review, so **smaller and focused contributions are preferred**.

## Third-Party Libraries

This repository contains several **third-party libraries**, including but not limited to:
- `h264bitstream`
- `libgamestream`
- `moonlight-common-c`
- `opus`
- `ports`

Important rules:
- These libraries **should not be modified manually** in feature pull requests.
- Changes should only come from the **official upstream repositories**.
- If an update to these libraries is needed, please discuss it with the maintainer first.

Pull requests that include manual modifications to these libraries **may be asked to revert those changes**.

## Code Style

- Follow the existing project structure and coding style.
- Avoid unnecessary refactoring in feature PRs.
- Keep changes minimal and directly related to the improvement or fix.

## Communication

Constructive discussions are always welcome. If you're unsure about a change or feature, feel free to **open an issue first before implementing it**.

This helps ensure the feature aligns with the direction of the project.

## Final Notes

Contributions are always appreciated. Clear, focused pull requests and well-described issues help keep the project healthy and easier to maintain for everyone.

This fork is not regularly maintained, so contributions may take a while to be reviewed.
